## Example 1: Prozone Effect Research

### User Query
```bash
/agent "What is the prevalence of prozone effect in highly sensitized patients?"
```

### Agent Execution Trace

```
[00:00] Agent Started - Analyzing query...
        Intent: Statistical query about HLA phenomenon
        Triggers: Medical terms detected, PubMed search initiated

[00:02] Step 1: Searching Knowledge Base
        Searching: ~/VM_F31_2025/Notes/2025_Specialist_Handouts/
        Found: Tambur_SAB_Interpretation.pdf (87 pages)
        Found: Gebel_Prozone_Workshop.pdf (43 pages)
        Found: Reed_Complement_Interference.pdf (31 pages)
        
[00:05] Step 2: Extracting Local Information
        From Tambur_SAB_Interpretation.pdf:
        - "Prozone observed in 76% of sera with cPRA >95%"
        - "EDTA treatment resolves 95% of cases"
        
        From professor's notes:
        - "We see prozone in nearly all highly sensitized patients"
        - "Standard protocol: Always dilute if cPRA >90%"

[00:08] Step 3: PubMed Query
        Query: ("prozone effect"[Title/Abstract] OR "prozone phenomenon"[Title/Abstract]) 
               AND ("HLA"[MeSH] OR "HLA antibodies"[Title/Abstract]) 
               AND ("highly sensitized"[All Fields] OR "cPRA"[All Fields])
        
        Results: 47 papers found
        Filtering: Last 5 years, human studies
        Relevant: 12 papers with prevalence data

[00:15] Step 4: Data Extraction

## Example 2: DSA Literature Review

### User Query
```bash
/agent "What is the incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients?"
```

### Agent Execution (Abbreviated)

```
[00:00-00:45] Complete workflow executing...

Key Steps:
1. Found 8 PDFs in LitReview folder about pediatric transplantation
2. PubMed: 127 papers → 23 relevant with pediatric dnDSA data
3. Extracted incidence rates: 15-25% at 5 years
4. Created research question + 5 concept pages
5. Identified risk factors: Non-adherence (OR 3.2), DQ mismatches (OR 2.8)
```

### Generated Research Question Note

```markdown
# What is the incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients?

## Key Findings

| Study | N | Age | Follow-up | dnDSA Incidence | Graft Survival Impact | PMID |
|-------|---|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Kim 2019 | 324 | 12±4 | 5 years | 23% | HR 4.5 for graft loss | 31402319 |
| Chaudhuri 2013 | 146 | 13±5 | 3 years | 18% | 45% vs 85% at 5yr | 23312360 |
| Ginevri 2012 | 82 | 11±4 | 5 years | 25% | OR 5.2 for rejection | 22229526 |

## Analysis

The incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients 
ranges from 15-25% at 5 years post-transplant, with higher rates observed in:
- Adolescents (30% vs 12% in younger children)
- Non-adherent patients (45% vs 14% in adherent)
- DQ-mismatched recipients (35% vs 15% in matched)

## Risk Factors
1. **Non-adherence**: Most significant modifiable factor (OR 3.2, p<0.001)
2. **HLA-DQ mismatch**: Strongest immunological factor (OR 2.8, p<0.001)
3. **Previous rejection**: Prior TCMR increases risk (OR 2.1, p=0.02)

## Advanced Workflow: Multi-Step Research

### Complex Query
```bash
/agent "Analyze the evolution of MFI cutoffs for virtual crossmatching from 2010-2024"
```

### Execution Shows Intelligent Planning

```
[00:00] Query decomposition:

[00:05] Structured approach:
        1. Historical papers (2010-2014)
        2. Transition period (2015-2019)
        3. Current standards (2020-2024)
        4. Identify trend and controversies

## Tips for Optimal Agent Use

### Query Formulation
- Be specific about population (pediatric, adult, sensitized)
- Include outcome of interest
- Specify timeframe if relevant

### Best Practices
1. Start broad, then refine
2. Check Memory MCP for previous related searches
3. Review generated concepts for completeness
4. Verify critical statistics manually

### When to Use Agent vs Direct Tools
- **Use Agent**: Complex multi-step research
- **Use Direct Search**: Known file location
- **Use PubMed MCP**: Single citation verification
- **Use Memory**: Recall previous findings
