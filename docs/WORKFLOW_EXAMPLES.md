## Example 1: Prozone Effect Research

### User Query
```bash
/agent "What is the prevalence of prozone effect in highly sensitized patients?"
```

### Agent Execution Trace

```
[00:00] Agent Started - Analyzing query...
        Intent: Statistical query about HLA phenomenon
        Triggers: Medical terms detected, PubMed search initiated

[00:02] Step 1: Searching Knowledge Base
        Searching: ~/VM_F31_2025/Notes/2025_Specialist_Handouts/
        Found: Tambur_SAB_Interpretation.pdf (87 pages)
        Found: Gebel_Prozone_Workshop.pdf (43 pages)
        Found: Reed_Complement_Interference.pdf (31 pages)
        
[00:05] Step 2: Extracting Local Information
        From Tambur_SAB_Interpretation.pdf:
        - "Prozone observed in 71% of high titer sera"
        - "EDTA treatment eliminates the prozone effect"
        
        From professor's notes:
        - "We see prozone in most highly sensitized patients"
        - "Standard protocol: Always dilute if high PRA or strong positivity"

[00:08] Step 3: PubMed Query
        Query: ("prozone effect"[Title/Abstract] OR "prozone phenomenon"[Title/Abstract]) 
               AND ("HLA"[MeSH] OR "HLA antibodies"[Title/Abstract]) 
               AND ("highly sensitized"[All Fields] OR "cPRA"[All Fields])
        
        Results: 47 papers found
        Filtering: Last 5 years, human studies
        Relevant: 12 papers with prevalence data

### Summary Returned to User
```
Found prevalence of prozone effect in highly sensitized patients:
- Overall: 71% in high titer sera (Tambur 2015)
- Mechanism: C1q complement interference at high antibody concentrations
- Detection: Requires serial dilutions or EDTA treatment
- Mitigation: EDTA treatment eliminates the prozone effect

## Example 2: DSA Literature Review

### User Query
```bash
/agent "What is the incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients?"
```

### Agent Execution (Abbreviated)

```
[00:00-00:45] Complete workflow executing...

Key Steps:
1. Found 8 PDFs in LitReview folder about pediatric transplantation
2. PubMed: 127 papers â†’ 23 relevant with pediatric dnDSA data
3. Extracted incidence rates: 30-35% at 5 years for DSA
4. Created research question + 5 concept pages
5. Identified risk factors: Non-adherence, DQ mismatches, prior rejection
```

### Generated Research Question Note

```markdown
# What is the incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients?

## Key Findings

| Study | N | Age | Follow-up | dnDSA Incidence | Graft Survival Impact | PMID |
|-------|---|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Kim et al. 2014 | 215 | Pediatric | Median 4.7yr | 35% developed DSA | 50% reduction in eGFR at 5.3yr | 25167892 |
| CERTAIN 2025 | 337 | Pediatric | 5 years | Class II: 30.6% at 5yr | ABMR in 10% acute, 5.9% chronic | 39283519 |
| Preka et al. 2021 | 56 | Pediatric | Variable | DSA+ with dysfunction | Better survival without v/t lesions | 34143297 |

## Analysis

The incidence of de novo DSA in pediatric kidney transplant recipients 
ranges from 30-35% at 5 years post-transplant, with class II DSA (especially DQ) 
being most common. Higher rates observed in:
- Adolescents compared to younger children
- Non-adherent patients
- HLA-DR mismatched recipients

## Risk Factors
1. **HLA-DR mismatch**: Significant risk factor (CERTAIN 2025)
2. **Non-adherence**: Major modifiable risk factor
3. **Double DSA positivity**: Class I + II highest risk for ABMR

## Advanced Workflow: Multi-Step Research

### Complex Query
```bash
/agent "Analyze the evolution of MFI cutoffs for virtual crossmatching from 2010-2024"
```

### Execution Shows Intelligent Planning

```
[00:00] Query decomposition:

        - Evolution implies changing standards

[00:05] Structured approach:
        1. Historical papers (2010-2014)
        2. Transition period (2015-2019)
        3. Current standards (2020-2024)
        4. Identify trend and controversies

[00:10-01:30] Systematic execution:
        - 147 papers analyzed

## Tips for Optimal Agent Use

### Query Formulation
- Be specific about population (pediatric, adult, sensitized)
- Include outcome of interest
- Specify timeframe if relevant

### Best Practices
1. Start broad, then refine
2. Check Memory MCP for previous related searches
3. Review generated concepts for completeness
4. Verify critical statistics manually

### When to Use Agent vs Direct Tools
- **Use Agent**: Complex multi-step research
- **Use Direct Search**: Known file location
- **Use PubMed MCP**: Single citation verification
- **Use Memory**: Recall previous findings
