# GitHub Copilot MCP Setup - Reality Check

## The Truth About GitHub Copilot MCP Support

After extensive testing, here's what actually works and what doesn't.

## ‚úÖ What Works

- **MCP Servers in Agent Mode**: GitHub Copilot CAN use MCP servers
- **PubMed Search**: Full literature search with PMID verification
- **Obsidian Integration**: Both file system and REST API access
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex reasoning capabilities
- **Custom Instructions**: Can configure agent-like behavior

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Different from Claude Code

### Installation Process
**Claude Code**: Run setup script ‚Üí Everything works

**GitHub Copilot**: 
1. Run setup script for base config
2. Open VS Code Command Palette
3. Search "Add MCP Server"
4. Select "NPM Package" 
5. Manually install EACH server:
   - `@nova-mcp/mcp-nova`
   - `@ncukondo/pubmed-mcp`
   - Others may auto-configure
6. Restart VS Code
7. Switch to Agent Mode
8. Select tools manually

### Usage Differences

**Claude Code**:
```
/agent "What causes prozone effect?"
# Automatically executes 7-8 steps, creates notes, cross-links
```

**GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**:
```
Use the pubmed tool to search for prozone effect
# Returns results

Now use the obsidian-file tool to create a note at [path]
# Creates note

Now create concept pages for key terms
# Must specify each one
```

## üî¥ Current Limitations

1. **No Autonomous Agent**: No equivalent to `/agent` command
2. **Manual Tool Selection**: Must explicitly choose tools for each task
3. **Memory Server Issues**: Nova memory server has configuration problems
4. **Manual Orchestration**: You become the workflow conductor
5. **VS Code Specific**: Only works in VS Code, not other editors

## üìä Comparison Matrix

| Task | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Install MCP servers | Automatic via script | Manual via VS Code UI |
| Execute multi-step workflow | Single command | Multiple manual commands |
| Create cross-linked notes | Automatic | Manual linking required |
| Memory persistence | Works | Currently broken |
| IDE requirement | None (terminal) | VS Code only |

## Should You Use This?

### Use GitHub Copilot MCP if:
- You're already using VS Code/GitHub Copilot daily
- You prefer manual control over each step
- You don't mind the setup complexity
- You want MCP tools integrated in your IDE

### Use Claude Code if:
- You want autonomous research workflows
- You need the `/agent` command
- You prefer terminal-based tools
- You want it to "just work"

## The Bottom Line

GitHub Copilot's MCP support is real but requires significant manual setup and operation. It's more like having a powerful toolkit that you manually operate, while Claude Code is like having an research assistant that uses the toolkit for you.

This is still valuable for VS Code users who want MCP capabilities integrated into their development environment, but it's not a drop-in replacement for Claude Code's agent system.
