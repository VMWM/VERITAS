## Detailed PMID Verification Requirements

### Verification Levels

- **[FT-VERIFIED]** - Full text confirms claim (via PMC or provided PDF)
- **[ABSTRACT-VERIFIED]** - Abstract clearly supports claim
- **[NEEDS-FT-REVIEW]** - Abstract ambiguous, needs full text review BUT still requires (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)

### Citation Rules

1. **No PMID = No claim** - If you cannot find a supporting PMID, remove the information entirely
2. **[NEEDS-FT-REVIEW] still requires citation** - Must include (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX) for user to find full text
3. **Never include unsupported information** - Better to have less content than unverified claims
4. **Every statistic needs a source** - All percentages, rates, and numbers require PMIDs

## Obsidian Formatting Guidelines

### Critical Formatting Rules

- **NO escaped newlines**: Use actual line breaks in content, not \n
- **Table formatting**: Must have spaces around pipes: `| Cell |`
- **Comparison symbols**: Use actual > < symbols in markdown files, NOT &gt; &lt; HTML entities
- **Mathematical symbols**: Prefer ≥ ≤ for "greater/less than or equal to" when available
- **Titles**: NO underscores in any H1 heading

### Table Guidelines

- **No mandatory metrics table** - Use tables only where they clarify complex relationships
- **Question-specific design** - Each table should directly answer part of the research question
- **Clinical relevance focus** - Include "what this means" not just raw numbers
- **Example good table**: Shows outcome differences by intervention/condition with clear headers
- **Avoid**: Lists of disconnected metrics without context

## Template Specifications

End with creation time and session status.

### Multi-Source Journal Integration

**PURPOSE**: Create comprehensive research journals by integrating multiple data sources.

**Workflow for "Generate journal entry" commands:**

1. **Query Conversation-Logger**: Use `mcp__conversation-logger__generate_journal` to get session data
2. **Search Memory MCP**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes` or `mcp__memory__open_nodes` for relevant research entities
3. **Synthesize in Obsidian**: Create journal combining both sources using templates

**Multi-Day Journal Creation:**

When user requests multi-day journals (e.g., "generate last 2 days' journal entries"):

**Behavior**: Create INDIVIDUAL daily entries for each requested day, NOT a summary

**Process for each day:**

1. Query conversation-logger for that specific date
2. Pull relevant memory MCP entities for that day's topics
3. Create separate journal entry in `/Obsidian/Research Journal/Daily/[DATE].md`
4. Use the Daily Journal Template for each entry

**Example**: "Generate last 3 days' journal entries" creates:

- `/Daily/2025-08-25.md` (Day 1 entry)
- `/Daily/2025-08-26.md` (Day 2 entry)
- `/Daily/2025-08-27.md` (Day 3 entry)

**Integration Commands:**

- Single day: Pull from conversation-logger + memory → Create in Daily/
- Multi-day: Iterate through each day → Create individual entries in Daily/
- Each entry follows the Daily Journal Template structure
- Always use Obsidian REST API for final journal creation
- NEVER output raw conversation-logger journal to user
- NEVER create summary files unless explicitly requested

### Algorithm Rule Template

**File naming**: RULE_[CATEGORY]_[SPECIFIC]_[NUMBER].md (e.g., `RULE_EPITOPE_BW6_001.md`)
**Location**: `/Users/vmwm/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Obsidian/HLA Antibodies/Rules/[Category]/`

**Categories**:

- Epitope_Patterns
- MFI_Thresholds
- Vendor_Specific
- Serologic_Mapping
- Quality_Control

**Template Structure:**

Front matter:

- rule_id: RULE_[CATEGORY]_[SPECIFIC]_[NUMBER]
- category: [epitope_pattern | mfi_threshold | vendor_specific | serologic_mapping | reporting | quality_control]
- priority: [critical | high | moderate | low]
- status: [implemented | ready_to_implement | in_development | proposed]
- created: YYYY-MM-DD
- updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- validated: [pending | partial | complete]
- tags: [relevant tags]

Required sections:

1. **Rule Summary** - One-sentence description of what this rule does and why it matters
2. **Clinical Context** - 2-3 sentences explaining clinical importance with embedded citations (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)
3. **Scientific Evidence** - List of supporting citations with verification levels [FT-VERIFIED], [ABSTRACT-VERIFIED], or [NEEDS-FT-REVIEW]
4. **Rule Definition** - YAML-formatted trigger conditions and detection logic
5. **Implementation** - Algorithm pseudocode and output actions
6. **Expert Annotation Options** - YAML-formatted dropdown options for benchmark dataset collection
7. **Validation Criteria** - Checklist of measurable success metrics
8. **Related Rules** - [[Wiki_Links]] to connected rules
9. **Edge Cases & Limitations** - Numbered list of known issues
10. **Integration Notes** - How rule fits in overall algorithm workflow
11. **Change Log** - Dated entries of updates

Use [[Wiki_Links]] for all related concepts and rules.
End with update date.

**AFTER CREATING/UPDATING A RULE:**

1. Rules are symlinked between Obsidian vault and automated-antibody-analysis repository
2. Changes in Obsidian immediately appear in Git repository (no sync needed)
3. Commit changes directly from repository: `git add rules/ && git commit -m "Update rules"`
4. Auto-indexer (`rules-auto-indexer.py`) updates Index.md and cross-references

**WHEN CREATING NEW RULES:**

1. Create in Obsidian at `HLA Antibodies/Rules/[Category]/RULE_*.md`
2. Reference related rules using [[RULE_CATEGORY_NAME_###]] format
3. Add to Related Rules section
4. Changes appear immediately in Git repository via symlink
5. No manual sync required - edit in Obsidian, commit from Git

## Detailed Workflow Processes

### Research Question Analysis Process (Grant-Focused Approach)

When answering research questions, prioritize creating grant-ready narrative content:

**Evidence Gathering:**

1. Decompose the question into component parts
2. Search PubMed comprehensively for all relevant evidence
3. Prioritize recent findings (2024-2025) and landmark studies
4. Verify each claim with proper PMID citations
5. Identify knowledge gaps suitable for grant justification

**Content Creation:**

1. Write Direct Answer as complete narrative prose with embedded citations
2. Structure Evidence-Based Key Points as flowing paragraphs, not bullet lists
3. Focus on grant application relevance throughout
4. Create Grant Writing Applications section with ready-to-use text
5. Ensure all content can be directly extracted for NIH F31 proposals

**Documentation Standards:**

- Prioritize narrative prose over complex multi-section structures
- Embed citations naturally within flowing text: (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)
- Write grant-ready paragraphs that require minimal editing for proposal use
- Focus on clinical significance and research impact
- Include quantitative data as supporting bullet points, not primary content structure
- Address NIH priorities: public health impact, innovation, feasibility

## Writing Standards

### Required Elements

- Direct statements with evidence
- Quantitative over qualitative
- Specific measurements
- NO em dashes
- NO dramatic language ("crucial", "vital")
- Limit use of emojis - okay to use basic emojis like check boxes, x marks, caution sign, etc

### Citation Format

- Format: (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)
- Tables: Must include PMID column
- Every claim needs verification
- State "requires verification" if no PMID

## Quality Checklist

Before any response:

- [ ] Used PubMed MCP for every claim
- [ ] Verified PMIDs support specific claims
- [ ] Included citations for ALL medical statements
- [ ] Flagged verification level
- [ ] Used system date for journal entries
- [ ] Followed exact templates
