Create a new research question following the VERITAS template:

1. Read `.claude/agents/hla-research-director.md` for the research question template
2. Ask me for the research question topic if not already provided
3. Search PubMed for relevant literature with verified PMIDs
4. Create a structured research question note with:
   - Direct Answer section (2-3 narrative paragraphs with embedded citations)
   - Evidence-Based Key Points (as narrative sections)
   - Quantitative Impact Summary (key statistics with citations)
   - Knowledge Gaps (research opportunities)
   - Grant Writing Applications (copy-paste ready text)
   - Full references with PMIDs and DOIs
5. Identify 2-3 key concepts and create concept pages with bidirectional links
6. Store key entities in Memory MCP
7. Save to Obsidian vault in Research Questions/ folder

All citations MUST include PMIDs and verification levels ([FT-VERIFIED], [ABSTRACT-VERIFIED], or [NEEDS-FT-REVIEW]).
