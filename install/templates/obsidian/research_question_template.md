# Research Question Title (No Question Mark)

## Direct Answer

[Write 2-3 narrative paragraphs that directly answer the research question. Use complete prose with embedded citations (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX) throughout. This section should be grant-ready text that can be directly copied into proposals. Focus on the most important findings and their clinical significance.]

[Second paragraph should expand on mechanisms or context with embedded citations. Continue the narrative flow.]

[Third paragraph should address clinical implications or future directions with embedded citations.]

## Evidence-Based Key Points
