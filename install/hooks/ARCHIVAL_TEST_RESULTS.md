# Hook Archival Test Results
Date: 2025-08-27

## Test Summary

### Hooks Tested
1. **first-response.py** - Forces instruction checking at conversation start
2. **compliance-validator.sh** - Validates Obsidian task compliance

### Test Method
- Temporarily disabled both hooks
- Tested VERITAS enforcement still works
- Checked for dependencies from other hooks
- Verified medical context detection still functions

### Results

#### first-response.py
- **Status**: SAFE TO ARCHIVE
- **Reason**: Redundant with pre-command.sh
- **Function**: Enforces Article 1 (sequential thinking) at conversation start
- **Coverage**: pre-command.sh already enforces this on EVERY command
- **Dependencies**: None found

#### compliance-validator.sh  
- **Status**: SAFE TO ARCHIVE
- **Reason**: Redundant with pre-command.sh
- **Function**: Checks for Obsidian-related tasks and enforces MCP usage
- **Coverage**: pre-command.sh already detects medical/scientific context and enforces tool usage
- **Dependencies**: None found

### Verification
With both hooks disabled:
- ✅ PMID requirements still enforced
- ✅ Medical context detection still works
- ✅ Tool priority order still enforced
- ✅ Obsidian formatting rules still active
- ✅ No errors from missing dependencies

### Recommendation
Archive both hooks as they are redundant with the more comprehensive pre-command.sh hook that runs before EVERY command (not just at conversation start).

### Essential Hooks (Final List)
1. pre-command.sh - Main enforcement (runs before every command)
2. post-command.sh - Bash validation (file extensions, formatting)
3. post-command.py - Python validation (PMID citations, claims)
4. auto-conversation-logger.py - Silent SQLite logging
5. task-router.py - Required by other hooks (module import)
6. enforce-claude-md.py - Required by other hooks (module import)
7. config.json - Hook configuration

Total: 6 hooks + 1 config file
