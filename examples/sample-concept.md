# Prozone Effect

## Definition
The prozone effect is a phenomenon in HLA antibody testing where high-titer antibodies paradoxically show low or negative MFI values on Single Antigen Bead (SAB) assays due to complement activation and C3 deposition blocking antibody detection sites.

## Key Points
- Occurs in 80% of highly sensitized patients (cPRA ≥95%)
- Primary cause: C3 complement fragment deposition
- Results in false-negative or falsely low antibody detection
- Prevented by EDTA treatment or serum dilution
- Major cause of virtual crossmatch errors

## Prevalence Data
| Population | Prevalence | Reference |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Highly sensitized (cPRA ≥95%) | 80% | Greenshields & Liwski 2019 |
| Previous transplant | 87% | Greenshields & Liwski 2019 |
| General Class I | 29.5% | Guidicelli et al. 2018 |
| General Class II | 45.9% | Guidicelli et al. 2018 |
| Post-transplant | 20% | Goldsmith et al. 2020 |

## Mechanism

### Primary Process
1. High-titer IgG binds to SAB beads
2. Complement cascade activation
3. C3 splits to C3b, then to C3d
4. C3d fragments coat bead surface
5. C3d blocks PE-conjugated detection antibody access
6. Low/negative MFI despite high antibody presence

### Secondary Mechanisms
- IgM interference (less common)
- Immune complex formation
- Fc receptor saturation

## Recognition Patterns

### Classic Indicators
- **Low MFI with high C3d binding** (>4000 MFI)
- **"Hockey stick" dilution curve**: MFI increases then decreases
- **EDTA rescue**: 2-10 fold MFI increase after treatment
- **Discordant complement binding**: High C1q with low IgG

### Laboratory Clues
- Known highly sensitized patient
- Unexpected negative crossmatch
- Historical antibody now "disappeared"
- Poor correlation between methods

## Detection Methods

### EDTA Treatment (Gold Standard)
- **Mechanism**: Chelates calcium, prevents complement
- **Protocol**: Add EDTA to 6-10mM final concentration
- **Sensitivity**: >90%
- **Specificity**: 100%

### Serum Dilution
- **Protocol**: 1:10, 1:100 serial dilutions
- **Pattern**: MFI increases with dilution (opposite of expected)
- **Use**: Confirmation method

### C3d Testing
- **Threshold**: C3d MFI >4000 predicts prozone
- **Sensitivity**: 95.2%
- **Specificity**: 97.2%

## Clinical Impact

### Virtual Crossmatch Errors
- False-negative DSA detection
- Inappropriate organ allocation
- Missed incompatibilities
- Potential hyperacute rejection

### Post-Transplant Monitoring
- Missed DSA development
- Delayed rejection diagnosis
- Inappropriate immunosuppression

### Desensitization Assessment
- Underestimated antibody burden
- Inadequate treatment
- False success metrics

## Prevention Strategies

### Routine EDTA Treatment
**Recommended for:**
- All highly sensitized patients (cPRA >80%)
- Pre-transplant final crossmatch
- Post-transplant DSA monitoring
- Desensitization protocol monitoring

### Implementation Protocol
1. Treat all sera with EDTA
2. Run parallel untreated sample
3. Compare MFI values
4. Flag significant increases (>2-fold)

## Cost Considerations
- EDTA treatment: Additional $50-100 per test
- Missed incompatibility: Potential graft loss ($200,000+)
- False-negative monitoring: Delayed rejection treatment ($30,000-50,000)
- Cost-benefit strongly favors routine treatment

## Quality Assurance

### Laboratory Requirements
- Document EDTA treatment protocol
- Establish MFI increase thresholds
- Validate with known positive samples
- Participate in proficiency testing

### Reporting Guidelines
- Report both treated and untreated values
- Flag suspected prozone cases
- Document complement interference
- Note interpretation limitations
