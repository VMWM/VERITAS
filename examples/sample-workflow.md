Step 1: Searching Knowledge Base
- Found: 2025_Specialist_Handouts/Tambur_SAB_Interpretation.pdf
- Found: LG Stuff/meeting_notes_prozone_discussion.md
- Extracted: "80% prevalence in cPRA ≥95% patients"

Step 2: PubMed Verification
- Query: "prozone effect" AND "HLA" AND "highly sensitized"
- Results: 47 papers found
- Relevant: 12 papers with prevalence data

Step 3: Data Extraction

## Key Findings

| Study | Population | Prevalence | Mitigation Success | PMID |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------------|------|
| Tambur 2015 | cPRA >95% (n=234) | 76% | EDTA: 95% | 25649423 |
| Schnaidt 2011 | Peak PRA >80% (n=156) | 82% | Heat: 88% | 21199346 |
| Weinstock 2013 | Retransplant (n=89) | 71% | DTT: 78% | 23294842 |

## Analysis

The prozone effect occurs in 70-85% of highly sensitized patients (cPRA ≥95%), 
caused by complement component C1q interfering with IgG detection at high antibody 
concentrations...

#### Prozone Effect.md
```markdown
# Prozone Effect

## Definition
False-negative or falsely low antibody detection in undiluted samples due to 
excess antibody causing complement interference in SAB assays.

## Key Points
- Prevalence: 70-85% in cPRA ≥95% patients
- Mechanism: C1q complement interference
- Detection: Requires sample dilution
- Clinical impact: Missed antibodies, failed transplants
