## Today's Focus
F31 Research Training Plan Development and HAML Documentation

## Completed Tasks

### F31 Application Progress
- [x] Reviewed Research Training Plan structure and requirements
- [x] Analyzed previous T32 and TL1 applications
- [x] Reviewed current prelim topic and background documents
- [x] Reviewed HAML materials and hackathon notes
- [x] Synthesized and proposed refined specific aims
- [x] Updated HLA_Antibody_Standardization_Synthesis.md with comprehensive [[HAML]] v0.4.4 details

### Refined Specific Aims Development
Developed three interconnected but independent aims for F31:

#### Aim 1: Standardization Framework
- Develop and validate standardized HLA antibody interpretation framework using [[HAML]] v0.4.4
- Implement in Tulane's HLA lab workflow
- Create rule-based and ML algorithms for [[MFI Cutoffs]]
- Document expert interpretation patterns

#### Aim 2: Weak Antibody Thresholds
- Establish evidence-based MFI thresholds for crossing weak [[Donor Specific Antibodies]]
- Analyze raw MFI data from 10 centers linked to outcomes
- Stratify by antigen locus and epitope patterns
- Resolve conflicting evidence (Yoo vs Morrison studies)

#### Aim 3: AAMMatch Tool
- Develop [[AAMMatch]] (Acceptable Antigen Molecular Match) clinical decision tool
- Combine EuroTransplant's acceptable mismatch with [[FIBERS]] molecular risk
- Validate in ethnically diverse cohorts (OPTN Region 3: 50% Black waitlist)
- Create web-based tool for real-time organ offer evaluation

### Documentation Updates
- Updated [[HAML]] concept in Obsidian vault with v0.4.4 specifications
- Added comprehensive XML schema examples
- Created implementation timeline with checkboxes
- Enhanced cross-linking between related concepts
- Added technical implementation details

## Key Insights

### HAML as Foundation
[[HAML]] v0.4.4 is THE critical infrastructure enabling:
- First-time harmonization of raw MFI data across centers
- Complete documentation of clinical reasoning chains
- Training data for standardization algorithms
- Integration point for [[AAMMatch]] tool

### Career Alignment
Research directly supports Director-in-Training pathway:
- Hands-on HLA lab experience
- Multi-center data analysis skills
- Clinical tool development
- Quality systems knowledge for ASHI accreditation

### Geographic Disparities Focus
Addressing critical disparity in Deep South (OPTN Region 3):
- Black candidates: 50% of waitlist vs 25% of population
- White candidates: 29% of waitlist vs 64% of population
- Donor pool mismatch creates HLA compatibility barriers

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Create detailed Specific Aims page (1 page)
- [ ] Begin Research Strategy section
- [ ] Draft Training Activities Timeline
- [ ] Review with [[Loren Gragert]]

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Complete Research Strategy (6 pages)
- [ ] Finalize Training Timeline (3 pages)
- [ ] Gather supporting preliminary data
- [ ] Prepare budget justification

### Medium-term (Next Month)
- [ ] Submit complete F31 application
- [ ] Prepare for potential revisions
- [ ] Continue HAML implementation at Tulane
- [ ] Begin algorithm development

## Related Concepts
- [[HAML]] - Data standardization infrastructure
- [[MFI Cutoffs]] - Standardization target
- [[Virtual Crossmatch]] - Clinical application
- [[Donor Specific Antibodies]] - Risk assessment
- [[AAMMatch]] - Novel clinical tool
- [[FIBERS]] - Molecular mismatch integration
- [[Sensitization]] - Patient population focus

## Reflections
The research aims are now clearly defined with strong rationale, feasibility, and innovation. The integration of [[HAML]] v0.4.4 as the foundational infrastructure ties everything together. The focus on addressing geographic disparities in sensitized patient access provides compelling significance for NIH reviewers.

The progression from standardization (Aim 1) to evidence generation (Aim 2) to clinical tool development (Aim 3) shows logical flow while maintaining independence - critical for F31 success.
