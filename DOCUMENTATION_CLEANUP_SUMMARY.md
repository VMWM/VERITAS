# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made (2025-01-20)

### 🎯 Problem Solved

The documentation had become fragmented and redundant with:

- PubMed setup in multiple places
- API setup spread across different files
- Overlapping content causing confusion
- Outdated information in some guides

### ✅ Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Consolidated Setup Guide

**New file: `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`**

- Combined all API setup instructions (Claude, Obsidian, PubMed)
- Added quick start section (5 minutes)
- Included CLI configuration commands
- Integrated troubleshooting for each component
- Clear, step-by-step instructions

#### 2. Archived Redundant Files

**Moved to .old extension:**

- `API_AND_PATH_SETUP.md` → `API_AND_PATH_SETUP.md.old`
- `PUBMED_SETUP.md` → `PUBMED_SETUP.md.old`

*These files are preserved but no longer linked in documentation*

#### 3. Created Documentation Index

**New file: `docs/README.md`**

- Clear categorization: Essential, Customization, Advanced
- Brief descriptions for each guide
- Notes about deprecated documents
- Quick navigation structure

#### 4. Streamlined Main README

- Simplified setup instructions
- Removed duplicate API key sections
- Added clear pointers to Setup Guide
- Organized documentation links by priority

### 📁 New Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Documentation index
├── SETUP_GUIDE.md            # ⭐ Complete setup (START HERE)
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md        # Detailed problem solutions
├── PERSONAL_SETUP.md         # Domain customization
├── AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION.md    # Agent creation

2. **No Redundancy**: Each topic covered once, thoroughly
3. **Clear Navigation**: Users know exactly where to look
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Update one file instead of multiple
5. **Better User Experience**: Streamlined onboarding process

**Before**: PubMed setup in 2-3 different places
**After**: One comprehensive section in Setup Guide

**Before**: Confusion about which doc to read
**After**: Documentation index with clear categories
