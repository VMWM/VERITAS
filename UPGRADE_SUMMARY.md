# VERITAS Upgrade Summary

**Modernized for Current Claude Code Capabilities**

## Overview

VERITAS has been upgraded to leverage Claude Code's built-in features and remove deprecated hook-based enforcement. The core mission remains unchanged: enforcing research integrity through verified citations and structured knowledge management.

## Major Changes

### 1. Removed Deprecated Hooks ✓
- **Deleted**: `.claude/hooks/` directory and all enforcement scripts
- **Reason**: Claude Code no longer supports pre/post-command hooks
- **Replacement**: CLAUDE.md enforced through output style system

### 2. Updated Article 4: Smart Execution Rules ✓
**NEW: Nuanced parallel/sequential execution guidance**

**MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL** (prevents API 400 errors):
- PDF files
- Large files (>1000 lines)
- Binary/media files
- Any heavy processing operations

**SAFE PARALLEL** (optimizes performance):
- Small text files (<500 lines)
- Independent PubMed searches
- Independent Memory MCP queries
- Mix of lightweight tool types

**Why this matters**: Based on real-world API errors when reading multiple PDFs simultaneously. This captures hard-won operational knowledge.

### 3. Added Article 8/9: TodoWrite Integration ✓
**NEW: Task management for complex workflows**

- Use TodoWrite for multi-step research tasks
- Track progress in real-time
- Only one task in_progress at a time
- Immediate completion marking

### 4. Updated Journal Workflow (Article 7) ✓
**Before**: Manual conversation-logger with SQLite
**Now**: Built-in JSONL transcript system

- Claude Code automatically logs to `~/.claude/projects/`
- `mcp__claude-transcript-reader__generate_journal` reads JSONL files
- LaunchAgent cleanup script manages 5-day retention
- No daemon needed - fully automatic

### 5. Simplified Sequential Thinking (Article 1) ✓
**Before**: "START WITH sequential-thinking for all complex tasks"
**Now**: "PLAN FIRST - use sequential-thinking only for highly complex multi-step tasks"

**Result**: Less overhead, faster responses, same quality

### 6. Created Slash Commands ✓
**NEW: Quick access to common workflows**

Created in `/install/templates/commands/`:
- `/research-question` - Create research questions with PMIDs
- `/concept-note` - Create concept notes with validation
- `/verify-citations` - Verify all PMIDs in files
- `/daily-journal` - Generate journal from transcripts

### 7. Simplified Installation ✓
**Removed**:
- Hook configuration steps
- Complex MCP setup for VS Code (now automatic)
- Manual logging setup

**Added**:
- Clearer distinction between VS Code (automatic) and Desktop (manual) MCP config
- Optional slash commands
- Simpler verification steps

## File Changes

### Updated Files
1. **CLAUDE.md** (root) - All article updates
2. **install/CLAUDE.md** - Template with same updates
3. **README.md** - Architecture, features, installation
4. **docs/getting-started.md** - MCP config clarity, removed hooks
5. **docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - NEW - Migration instructions

### New Files
1. **install/templates/commands/research-question.md**
2. **install/templates/commands/concept-note.md**
3. **install/templates/commands/verify-citations.md**
4. **install/templates/commands/daily-journal.md**
5. **install/templates/commands/README.md**
6. **docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**
7. **UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md** (this file)

### Deprecated (can be removed)
- `install/hooks/` directory (entire directory deprecated)
- References to "conversation-logger" MCP (replaced with "claude-transcript-reader")

## MCP Server Status

| Server | VS Code Extension | Claude Desktop | Notes |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| sequential-thinking | ✓ Auto | Manual config | Less frequently needed now |
| memory | ✓ Auto | Manual config | Same usage |
| pubmed | ✓ Auto | Manual config | Same usage |
| filesystem-local | ✓ Auto | Manual config | Same usage |
| claude-transcript-reader | ✓ Auto | Manual config | Replaces conversation-logger |

## Breaking Changes

### For Existing Users

1. **Hooks no longer work** - Must remove `.claude/hooks/` directory
2. **conversation-logger MCP replaced** - Use `claude-transcript-reader` instead
3. **Sequential thinking less frequent** - This is intentional and beneficial
4. **No pre-command reminders** - CLAUDE.md loaded automatically by Claude Code

### For New Users

No breaking changes - all features work out of the box with VS Code extension.

## Benefits

1. **Simpler** - Fewer moving parts, no hook configuration
2. **Faster** - Less overhead from mandatory sequential thinking
3. **Smarter** - Parallel execution when safe, sequential when required
4. **More Reliable** - Built-in Claude Code features vs custom scripts
5. **Better UX** - TodoWrite tracking, slash commands, automatic logging
6. **Future-Proof** - Aligned with Claude Code's evolution
