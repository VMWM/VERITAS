## ü§ñ What is This?

This system supercharges Claude Code by connecting it to:
- **PubMed** - Search literature, verify citations, get PMIDs in real-time
- **Obsidian** - Automatically create structured notes in your knowledge vault
- **Memory** - Remember your research context across sessions
- **Your Files** - Read PDFs, analyze data, process documents
- **Sequential Thinking** - Handle complex multi-step research tasks

### In Practice:
Instead of manually searching papers, copying citations, and creating notes, you can:
```
/agent "Find recent papers on prozone effect in HLA testing and create a summary note"
```

Claude will:
1. Search PubMed for relevant papers
2. Read and synthesize the findings
3. Create a properly formatted note in Obsidian
4. Link it to related concepts
5. Remember the key findings for future queries

### Who Is This For?
- **HLA Researchers** who need rigorous citation management
- **Transplant Immunologists** working on clinical studies
- **Laboratory Directors** managing quality standards
- **PhD Students** conducting systematic literature reviews
- **Clinicians** who need evidence-based HLA interpretations
- **Anyone** who values accuracy and PMID-verified citations

## üí° Why This Exists

I built this while working on my F31 grant proposal. I needed to:
- Review hundreds of papers on HLA antibody testing
- Keep track of conflicting findings across studies
- Build a knowledge graph of interconnected concepts
- Generate evidence-based research questions
- Document daily progress without losing context

Manual tools weren't cutting it. This system automated the tedious parts while keeping me in control of the thinking.

## üéØ Two Ways to Use This System

### Option 1: Use My Exact HLA Setup
Perfect if you're working on:
- HLA antibody research
- Transplant immunology  
- Clinical histocompatibility testing
- Multi-center standardization studies
- Any HLA-related research requiring verified citations

‚Üí Follow the setup as-is and get my complete HLA research environment

### Option 2: Customize for Your Research Domain
Adapt this system for:
- Cancer biology, neuroscience, cardiology, etc.
- Different vault structures
- Custom agent personalities
- Your preferred cloud storage

‚Üí See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for adaptation

## üöÄ Quick Start (10 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- macOS
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (required for Claude Code)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - Install via VS Code or npm
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with Local REST API plugin
- Claude API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Cloud storage (iCloud, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, or OneDrive)

### Step 1: Install Claude Code (if needed)

**Option A: Via VS Code Extension**
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (‚åò‚áßX)
3. Search for "Claude Code"
4. Install the extension

**Option B: Via npm**
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Step 2: Clone and Run Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VMWM/HLA_Agent-MCP_System.git
cd HLA_Agent-MCP_System
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- ‚úÖ Install Claude Code CLI tool (if not already installed)
- ‚úÖ Install all 5 MCP servers (Memory, PubMed, Obsidian, Filesystem, Sequential Thinking)
- ‚úÖ Ask you to choose your cloud provider (iCloud, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, OneDrive, or custom)
- ‚úÖ Create directory structure in your chosen cloud location
- ‚úÖ Set up configuration templates
- ‚úÖ Copy knowledge base template (includes HLA examples, but customizable for any domain)

**After setup, run validation:**
```bash
./scripts/validate_setup.sh
```
This checks all components are properly installed and configured.

**Note**: PubMed MCP may need manual configuration. See [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if it shows "Failed to connect".

### Step 3: Set Up Obsidian

> **üìå NOTE**: This system comes with HLA research vaults as examples. 
> **To customize for your research**: See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md)

#### Option A: Single Vault (Simpler)
Everything in one Obsidian vault:
1. Open Obsidian ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí Browse
2. Search "Local REST API" ‚Üí Install and Enable
3. In plugin settings ‚Üí Copy API key (save for Step 3)
4. Ensure HTTPS enabled on port 27124

#### Option B: Two-Vault System (Recommended)
Separate research notes from daily journal:

**Vault Structure:**
```
Obsidian/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Your Research Topic]/      # e.g., "HLA Antibodies"
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Concepts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Research Questions/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Research Journal/            # Daily notes
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Daily/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects/
```

**Setup:**
1. **Research vault** (port 27124):
   - Install Local REST API ‚Üí Copy API key for `obsidian-rest-hla`
2. **Journal vault** (port 27125):
   - Install Local REST API ‚Üí Change port to 27125 ‚Üí Copy API key

**Benefits:**
- Agent automatically routes content to correct vault
- Research stays organized separately from daily notes
- No manual vault switching needed

### Step 4: Configure API Keys

> **üìã NEW**: Use [docs/SETUP_CHECKLIST.md](docs/SETUP_CHECKLIST.md) for a complete walkthrough with validation steps!

**See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.**

Edit the configuration file:
```bash
# Location depends on your cloud provider:
# iCloud: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/claude-desktop-config.json
# Dropbox: ~/Dropbox/MCP-Shared/claude-desktop-config.json
# Box: ~/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/MCP-Shared/claude-desktop-config.json
```

Required keys:
1. **Claude API Key** - From [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **PubMed Email** - Any valid email (API key optional)
3. **Obsidian API Key(s)** - From Step 2 above

The setup script creates a template showing exactly where to add these.

### Step 5: Add CLAUDE.md to Your Project

**CRITICAL:** The agent file MUST be named `CLAUDE.md` in your project folder:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the included HLA research agent
cp ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/HLA_Agent-MCP_System/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/

# Option 2: Create your own custom agent
cp ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/HLA_Agent-MCP_System/templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

This file tells Claude how to behave for your specific research domain. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è KEY FEATURES of CLAUDE.md v5.1 (Public Release):**
- **MANDATORY PMID verification** for ALL medical/scientific claims
- **Three-tier verification system**: [FT-VERIFIED], [ABSTRACT-VERIFIED], [NEEDS-FT-REVIEW]
- **Anti-fabrication safeguards** - explicitly states "requires verification" when uncertain
- **PubMed-first approach** - searches literature before making any medical claims
- **Template-based note creation** - ensures consistent, high-quality documentation
- **Suitable for public sharing** - proprietary research details removed

### Step 6: Test Your Setup

```bash
claude
```

Then in Claude:
```
/mcp
```

You should see 5 servers connected:
- ‚úÖ memory
- ‚úÖ pubmed
- ‚úÖ obsidian-rest
- ‚úÖ filesystem-local
- ‚úÖ sequential-thinking

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

### What You Can Do
```bash
# Literature Review
/agent "Find papers from 2020-2024 on prozone effect in HLA testing, create summary"

# Concept Development
/agent "Create a concept note on MFI cutoffs with clinical decision thresholds"

# Daily Documentation
/agent "Create today's research journal entry with progress on Aim 2"

# Knowledge Synthesis
/agent "Compare Halifax vs EDTA protocols for prozone detection"

# Grant Writing

```

### How It's Different
| Traditional Workflow | This System |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Search PubMed manually | Claude searches and filters |
| Copy/paste citations | Auto-generates with PMIDs |
| Create notes manually | Auto-creates in Obsidian |
| Lose context between sessions | Memory persists everything |
| Manage references manually | Auto-links related concepts |
| Switch between tools | Everything in one terminal |

## üé≠ Custom Agent System

**IMPORTANT:** Agent files must be named `CLAUDE.md` in your project folder.

### Using the HLA Research Agent
```bash
# Copy to your project AS CLAUDE.md
cp ~/Library/"Mobile Documents"/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/HLA_Agent-MCP_System/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
```

### Creating Your Own Agent
```bash
# 1. Start with template
cp ~/Library/"Mobile Documents"/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/HLA_Agent-MCP_System/templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md ./CLAUDE.md

# 2. Edit CLAUDE.md to add your domain knowledge

# 3. Save as a reusable agent for future projects (optional)
mkdir -p ~/Library/"Mobile Documents"/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/agents/
cp ./CLAUDE.md ~/Library/"Mobile Documents"/com~apple~CloudDocs/MCP-Shared/agents/My-Domain-Agent.md
```

Agents can be specialized for any research domain or task.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### MCP servers not showing as connected?
```bash
# Restart Claude Code
claude

# Check servers
/mcp
```

### Obsidian REST API connection refused?
1. Ensure Obsidian is running
2. Check Local REST API plugin is enabled
3. For dual vault: Ensure ports are different (27124 & 27125)

### Dual Vault Setup Issues?

**Both vaults using same port?**
- HLA Antibodies: Keep port 27124
- Research Journal: Change to port 27125 in Advanced Settings

**Only one vault connecting?**
- Verify both Obsidian windows are open
- Check both API keys are different
- Ensure config has both `obsidian-rest-hla` and `obsidian-rest-journal`

**iCloud sync conflicts?**
- Choose "Modified recently" when prompted
- Let iCloud fully sync before testing

### Testing Dual Vault Connection
```bash
# In Claude Code, verify both servers:
/mcp

# Should show:
‚úÖ obsidian-rest-hla
‚úÖ obsidian-rest-journal
```
3. Verify API key matches in both Obsidian and config
4. Confirm HTTPS on port 27124

### Files created with JSON wrappers?
This happens if the API format is wrong. Ensure your CLAUDE.md is in the project folder.

### "Access denied" errors?
You're using the wrong MCP server. Use `obsidian-rest` for Obsidian operations, not `filesystem-local`.
