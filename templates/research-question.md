# [Research Question - Must End with ?]

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value/Estimate | Citation | Verification |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| [Primary outcome] | XX% (range) | (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX) | [ABSTRACT-VERIFIED] |
| [Secondary metric] | Value Â± SD | (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX) | [FT-VERIFIED] |
| [Key comparison] | XX vs YY | (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX) | [NEEDS-FT-REVIEW] |

## Detailed Analysis

### Historical Baseline Data (Year Range)
[Establish foundation with landmark studies. Every claim must include (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)]

### Mechanisms/Biological Basis
[Explain underlying processes with evidence. Link to [[Related Concepts]] using wiki links]

### Recent Data (2024-2025)
[Current literature with emphasis on what's new. All statistics need PMIDs]

### Risk Factors/Stratification
**High-risk groups**:
- Group 1: OR/HR with CI (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)
- Group 2: Quantified risk factors (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)

## Current Understanding (2024-2025)
[Synthesis paragraph of current knowledge, recent advances, remaining questions]

## Limitations
- Study design limitations with examples
- Methodological concerns (measurement issues, bias)
- Gaps in current literature
- Conflicting findings and potential explanations

## Clinical/Research Implications
1. **Monitoring/Screening**: Evidence-based recommendations with PMIDs
2. **Risk assessment**: Actionable stratification criteria
3. **Interventions**: Treatment options with supporting evidence
4. **Implementation**: Practical considerations for application

## Conclusion
[One paragraph directly answering the research question based on all evidence presented]
