# Daily Research Log: YYYY-MM-DD

## Session Summary

- **Primary Focus**: Main research topic or task
- **Duration**: X hours Y minutes
- **Key Achievement**: Most significant accomplishment

## Technical Implementations

### Major Tasks

| Task | Tool/Method | Findings | Commands | Results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Literature search | PubMed MCP | X papers on topic | `mcp__pubmed__search_pubmed` | Key thresholds identified |
| Data analysis | Python/R | Statistical significance | `script.py` | p<0.05 for primary outcome |
| Note creation | Obsidian REST | Research question documented | `POST /vault/...` | Complete with PMIDs |

## Research Insights

### Key Findings

1. **Finding 1**: Specific discovery with quantitative data (Author et al., Year, PMID: XXXXXXXX)
2. **Finding 2**: Important observation with implications
3. **Finding 3**: Unexpected result requiring further investigation

### Analysis

Paragraph explaining how findings connect to research aims and what they mean for the project.

### Impact

How these findings advance the research or change understanding.

## Decisions & Rationale

| Choice | Evidence-Based Reasoning |
| --- | --- |
| Selected method X over Y | Literature shows X has higher sensitivity (PMID: XXXXXXXX) |
| Chose threshold of Z | Based on ROC analysis showing optimal cutoff |
| Prioritized task A | Critical path for upcoming deadline |

## Problems Solved

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API connection failed | SSL certificate mismatch | Updated certificate path |
| Table formatting broken | Missing spaces in pipes | Added proper spacing |
| Memory MCP incorrect data | Unverified previous chat | Verified via PubMed |

## Session Metrics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Papers reviewed | X (all with verified PMIDs) |
| Notes created | Y (research questions: A, concepts: B) |
| Time invested | X hours Y minutes |
| PMIDs verified | Z/Z (100%) |
| Code written | X lines |
| Verification level | All [ABSTRACT-VERIFIED] or [FT-VERIFIED] |

## Next Actions

### Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Task 1 with specific deliverable
- [ ] Task 2 with deadline
- [ ] Task 3 with dependency

### This Week's Goals
- Complete analysis of X
- Draft section Y of manuscript
- Review Z additional papers

### Open Questions
- Question 1 requiring literature search
- Question 2 needing statistical consultation
- Question 3 for supervisor discussion
